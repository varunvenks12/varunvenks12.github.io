  <h5>Here's my 4th-time trek experience to Kumaraparvatha ðŸŒ„</h5> </center>

    <center> <h4> INTRODUCTION </h4> </center>
    <div class="col-sm-6 p-3">
    <p> Most of you are aware that I trekked Kumaraparvatha during the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. I hadnâ€™t expressed in writing from the previous visits to KP (Kumaraparvatha). This reading will have in detail itinerary, planning, pictures, and a complete guide if you are interested to trek.</p>
      <p>Kumaraparvatha is the fourth highest peak in Karnataka (5,617 ft/ 1712 m), after Tadiandamol Peak (5735 ft / 1748 m). However, this is named first and highest in terms of trek.</p>
      <p> <b>History of Kumaraparvatha: </b>
The divine serpent Vasuki whom Lord Shiva wore as an ornament around his neck, was threatened by Garuda ( mount/Vahana of Lord Vishnu). Vasuki performed tapas (worship) for numerous years in the caves of Kukke Subhramaniya temple trying to avoid attacks from Garuda. Lord Shiva decided to send his son Kartikeya to protect Vasuki from Garuda. Apparently Kartikeya visited Kumara Parvatha and blessed Vasuki that he shall stay with him forever. From then onwards the pooja offered to serpent shall be considered as the pooja offered to Kartikeya himself.</p>

    <center> <h4>PLANNING</h4>
    <div class="col-sm-12 p-3">
    <p> The plan was initiated during the last week of November and were seven of usâ€”four who had previously trekked KP, and three who were new to the experience. Considering year end leaves, we planned to reserve transportation well in advance.  We preferred the bus over the train because the bus reached the destination earlier than the train. Reserved onward and return bus tickets. Carried breakfast and lunch for a day. Shopped tablets, snacks, energy drinks and bites. Booked camping tents in advanced and carried from Bangalore. </p>

         <li>At 10:40 AM, we reached a mid-point where there's a waterfall which is 100m diversion from the actual route. We filled our water bottles, took some pictures and continued towards Girigadde.</li>
         <li>At 1:00 PM, we reached Bhatrumane, At first sight, we saw a crowd with plates waiting for lunch, Many of those who made it to peak the same day and to descend back to Kukke Subramanya.</li>
         <li>Although we were concerned about finding a camping site, we had to fill our stomachs first, therefore we waited until the first crowd to finish lunch. By 2:15 PM we completed our meal and started towards forest office at Girigadde.</li>
         <li>We reported to the forest officer with head count and with the tents that we carried. They suggested a place to pitch our tents.

         <li>By 3:15PM, we had both the tents set up. That was all for the day. We had enough time to rest until 5:30PM.</li>
         <li>At 5:30 PM, we all headed to Kumaraparvatha First View Point to witness the sunset, took some pictures, made calls to family members. Upon reaching the camp, had snacks and engaged in chit-chat. We were lazy to walk to Bhatrumane for dinner and a very few went to have dinner.</li>
         <li>The day winded up early at 9:00 PM. We were already listening the noise of new year celebration in other camps. We were all set to wake up at 4:00 AM and the permissible trek start time is 5:00 AM.</li>
